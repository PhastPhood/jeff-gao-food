# Hand-pulled noodles

These noodles are super satisfying to make and eat. The rough texture and edges help pick up sauce and gives it a rustic look. Using high-gluten flour also makes the noodles chewy, and the uneven thickness gives a bit of variation in bite.

## Ingredients
| Ingredient                | Amount            | Details   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| 00 flour                  | 300g              | You can use bread flour, but the ratios here are for Italian '00' flour, which stretches better because of the finer milling. Caputo brand is the golden standard. You can buy '00' flour in bulk at PFI in Seattle or in 1kg bags at DeLaurenti, though you're paying for the tourist markup there. The red Rinforzato bags, the blue Pizzeria bags, and the red Chef's Flour bags are all the same thing. |
| Water                     | 150g              | Amount may vary, add a little less at first and add in as needed. |
| Salt                      | 2g                | This adds a bit of flavor, and a small amount helps the dough stretch. Be careful because too much salt toughens the gluten and actually makes it harder to stretch. |
| Oil                       | 4g                | Fat inhibits gluten development, so adding a bit of oil helps the noodles stretch more easily |

Anyways, these are the basic ratios that work for me. Basically, you want enough water to make the dough as well as some fat and salt to make it easier to stretch. You could do weird things/add flavor by subbing parmesan instead of the fat and salt, use wine instead of water, whatever.

### 1. Make dough.
  Put the flour and salt in the bowl, and make a little well at the top. Pour oil into the well. Then add water slowly into the well while mixing. Knead the dough until it's smooth. You may need to add a bit more water or flour – it should be a very slightly sticky dough. Roll into a log, wrap in plastic wrap, then let rest in the fridge for a few hours (>4 hours is probably enough).

### 2. Prep noodles
  Take your dough out of the fridge and let it come up to room temperature. Split your dough log into 8 segments. For each segment, brush with a little bit of oil on the top and bottom, then roll the dough a little flatter. The oil helps the noodle stretch a bit better and keeps it from sticking. It doesn't really matter how flat you roll your dough here, I usually do it about 1/2 an inch thick. Using a bench scraper or chopstick, push an indent lengthwise through the middle of your dough. Cover your dough pieces lightly with a damp paper towel or plastic wrap, then let rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, boil a pot of water (salt the water if you want).

### 3. Pull noodles
  Slowly stretch each dough piece until it reaches your desired thickness. Swinging the dough up and down and slapping it against the counter helps it stretch. When your dough is the desired thickness, split the noodle from the indent in the middle you created earlier. Traditionally, you leave the noodle intact at the ends, but it's a bit easier to eat if you split the dough all the way.
  
### 4. Cook noodles
  Drop your noodle immediately into boiling water, then give your noodle a stir so it doesn't stick. Your noodle is done cooking once it floats (about 30 seconds).

## Troubleshooting
__My noodles won't stretch well or are breaking__ – let your dough rest longer before pulling. Try adding a bit less salt or a bit more oil to the dough.
