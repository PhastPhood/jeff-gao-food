# EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT BOBA

## Boiling boba

General instructions, will work for most brands

1 cup of uncooked boba is good for 1 glass of boba

* Sift the boba using a spider strainer (or anything that’ll let cracked chunks of boba fall through). Basically, you want to get rid of excess starch that’ll make your boba too gooey, and you want to get rid of small pieces of boba since you want your boba to be consistent.
* Boil boba for 35 minutes.
    * The recommended ratio is at least 6 cups of water to 1 cup of boba, but if you sift enough, you can probably do 4 cups of water to 1 cup of boba.
    * At hot temperatures, boba is a lot softer. What you’re looking for at the end of the boiling period is that the boba is cooked all the way through - it should be soft and chewy from the outside to the inside (not chalky or crunchy)
* Turn off the heat and let the boba sit in the cooking water for 30 minutes.
    * This just helps the boba absorb more water
* Rinse the boba using cold water and strain.
    * I rinse by dumping out excess water, then filling the pot with water, stirring around, and straining. I do this a couple times. You basically want to rinse off excess starch from the boba so that it’s not too slimy on the outside.
* Steep the boba in syrup for at least 15 minutes
    * I like using honey syrup. My ratios (by volume) are 2 parts water, 2 parts sugar, and 1 part honey. Or by weight, 8:6:3 (water:sugar:honey). 
    * I use turbinado sugar, which has a bit of a molasses flavor, but 50% white sugar and 50% brown sugar is also common
    * You only need to add enough syrup so that all the boba is submerged, which is a lot less than you think. Give it a stir so that the boba doesn’t stick together.

## Tea

I think it’s best to make a tea concentrate (high ratio of tea to water), straining the tea, then cooling the tea by adding cold water after it’s finished steeping. This way, your won’t melt the ice later. You can also just steep your tea normally and let it sit in the fridge til it’s cool. For boba, since you’re adding milk and sugar, you want to boil your tea strong. A little bit of bitterness is ok (and maybe good) since you’ll add milk and sugar, but it’s easy to go overboard if you oversteep.

Here are my general ratios and timings - it’s highly dependent on your specific tea.

| Tea type | Amount of tea (g) | Steeping water (g) | Cooling water (g) | Temperature (F) | Steep time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Black | 5 | 100 | 100 | 185 | 8:00 |
| Jasmine | 5 | 100 | 100 | 170 | 4:00 |
| Oolong | 6 | 100 | 100 | 185 | 8:00 |

If your tea tastes too watery, you can try increasing the amount of tea, increasing the temperature, or steeping for longer. If it’s too bitter/astringent, you can try lowering the temperature of the water you use or steeping for less time.

## Assembling

These are my general ratios for milk teas:
• 3/4 cups tea (~180 grams)
• 2 tablespoons half and half (~30 grams)
    • You want to use a half and half where the cream flavor isn’t overpowering. Most generic store brands will work, but some bougie milks are too strong.
• 3 tablespoons of 1:1 simple syrup for full sweetness
    • Measuring by weight is the best way to be consistent, especially since 1 cup of sugar varies wildly based on how granular your sugar is. I do 3 oz sugar to 4 oz water (1 cup sugar to 1 cup water, but my sugar is very granular).
    • Basically, you just heat water and sugar on medium heat until all the sugar is dissolved

You can just add boba to your glass, add ice, add your ingredients and stir, but I think the boba is better if you shake it with ice. Shaking with ice then straining will chill your tea so that it won’t dilute as much in your glass, and it aerates the drink which creates a frothier texture.

## Matcha

Matcha’s a bit different since the matcha flavor is a lot stronger, so you can use whole milk instead of creating a concentrate and adding half and half. 

Matcha has different grades based on the quality - you want to use latte grade matcha since you’re basically making an iced latte.

Here are my general instructions:
* Add boba to your glass
* Add 3 tablespoons 1:1 simple syrup for full sweetness
    * Whisk 3 grams (~1 teaspoon) matcha in hot (~180 degrees F) water (you might be able to use cold water which would be better because it wouldn’t melt the ice, still have to experiment with this)
* You basically want to add enough water so that you can dissolve your matcha evenly and it’s liquidy instead of pasty. Maybe about 1/8 cup water.
* Add ice to glass
* Add 1 cup milk to glass
* Add matcha water to glass
    * This creates a gradient. You could also shake if you wanted, which would probably taste better, but be less instagramable.
