# Hand-pulled noodles (biang biang mian)

In-progress, pics coming soon

V EASY TO MAKE (AND EAT). The rough texture and edges help pick up sauce and gives it a rustic look. Using high-gluten flour also makes the noodles chewy, and the uneven thickness gives a bit of variation in bite.

## Ingredients
| Ingredient                | Amount            | Details   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| 00 flour                  | 300g              | You can also use bread flour, but you'll likely have to rest the dough for longer. '00' flour also stretches better because of the finer milling. Caputo brand is the golden standard. You can buy '00' flour in bulk at PFI in Seattle or in 1kg bags at DeLaurenti, though you're paying for the tourist markup there. The red Rinforzato bags, the blue Pizzeria bags, and the red Chef's Flour bags are all the same thing. |
| Water                     | 150g              | Add a little less at first and add in as needed. |
| Salt                      | 2g                | A small amount of salt helps the dough stretch. Be careful because too much salt toughens the gluten and actually makes it harder to stretch. |
| Oil                       | 4g                | Fat inhibits gluten development, so adding a bit of oil helps the noodles stretch more easily. Any neutral flavored oil works here. |

Anyways, these are the basic ratios that work for me. Basically, you want enough water to make the dough even and a tiny bit sticky, as well as some fat and salt to make it easier to stretch. You could do weird things/add flavor by subbing parmesan instead of the fat and salt, use wine instead of water, whatever.

### 1. Make dough.
  Put the flour and salt in the bowl, and make a little well at the top. Pour the oil into the well. Then add water slowly into the well while mixing with a fork. Use your hands to knead the dough until it's smooth. You may need to add a bit more water or flour – it should be a slightly sticky dough. Roll into a log, wrap in plastic wrap, then let rest on the counter for an hour. If you're doing ahead of time, you can let it rest in the fridge. Around 4 hours in the fridge is probably enough, but letting it rest longer will continue to make it easier to stretch (up to a day or two).

### 2. Prep noodles
  Take your dough out of the fridge and let it come up to room temperature. Roll it into a log, then split your dough log into 8 segments. For each segment, brush with a little bit of oil on the top and bottom, then roll the dough flatish. The oil helps the noodle stretch a bit better and keeps it from sticking. It doesn't really matter how flat you roll your dough here, I usually do it about 1/2 an inch thick. Using a bench scraper or chopstick, push an indent lengthwise through the middle of your dough. Cover your dough pieces lightly with a damp paper towel or plastic wrap, then let rest on the counter for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, boil a pot of water (salt the water if you want).

### 3. Pull noodles
  Slowly stretch each dough piece by pulling outward and swinging the dough up and down. Slapping it against the counter also helps it stretch. When your dough is the desired thickness, split the noodle from the indent in the middle you created earlier. Traditionally, you leave the noodle intact at the ends, but it's a bit easier to eat if you split the noodle all the way.
  
### 4. Cook noodles
  Drop your noodle immediately into boiling water, then give your noodle a stir with a chopstick or fork so it doesn't stick. Your noodle is done cooking once it floats (about 30 seconds).

## Troubleshooting
__My noodles won't stretch well or are breaking__ – let your dough rest longer before pulling. Try adding a bit less salt or a bit more oil to the dough.
